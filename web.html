    20 Types of Berries and Their Health Benefits
    
    Blackberries
    
    As with all berries, blackberries also contain various health-protective polyphenols.
    
    Blackberries show a significant protective effect against LBL-oxidation, a promiment cardiovascular risk factor, in human intervention studies (6).
    
    Studies also show that wild blackberries are 3 to 5 times higher in polyphenols, so get outside and pick your own.
